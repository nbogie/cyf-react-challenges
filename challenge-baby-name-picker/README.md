# Challenge: "Baby Name Picker (React)"

![Example Screenshot from the finished challenge](./example-screenshots/finished.png)

## Challenge Overview

Make a React app which shows some baby names and lets you pick your favourites. The names data is provided for you.

## Difficulty Level

This is a beginner challenge.  Level one can be completed by any student who has done week 1 of the CYF React module.

The later levels are suitable from students who have completed at least week 2 of the CYF React module.

## Pre-requisites - what do I need to know to finish this challenge?

(Level 1)

- React `props`
- The `array.map` method and its use in React JSX

(Later levels)

- Event handlers: onClick for buttons
- Event handlers: onChange for input fields
- The `useState` hook

## Getting Started

**Don't** clone this repo.

Make your own React app using `create-react-app`.  See [(this guide)](https://docs.codeyourfuture.io/students/guides/creating-a-react-app) if you have forgotten how.

Copy across the names file (or its contents) from this repo to your app, and then import from that file.

Write a plain HTML prototype (e.g. on codepen).  THEN, once you know the HTML you're attempting to create, work on the React version!  This is not mandatory but it is recommended.

### The data:

The data is available in the file [./babyNamesData.json](./babyNamesData.json).

Copy across this file to your src/ directory, and then import it.

## GitHub & Hosting:

Add your project in github and host it on Netlify.

The github repo name should be exactly:
`baby-names-react`

The netlify site suffix should be `-baby-names`

so...

`cyf-YOURGITHUBUSERNAME-baby-names`

# Level 1 Challenge

* Write a react app which lists baby names from the given file.

* It should display boys' and girls' names differently - your choice*

* The names should be displayed in alphabetical order, ascending.

* Your project should be on GitHub and Netlify with correct names (see Hosting, above).

(*) Please, please feel free to break from the the "blue-for-boys/pink-for-girls" stereotyping and style it differently.  The best creative solution will be included in this challenge document for subsequent cohorts to admire.

# Level 2 challenge

* Add a search bar.

* When someone types into it, your app should update the displayed list of baby names to only show matches.

* Matches should be case-insensitive.

* When the search bar is clear, all names should be shown.

# Level 3 challenge

* Add "favourites".

* When the user clicks a name from the main list, it should be moved to a "favourites" list, displayed separately.
It should disappear from the main list!

* When the user clicks a name from the _favourites_ list, it should be moved back to the main list.  It should disappear from the favourites list!

# Level 4 challenge

Add "name gender" filter buttons.

Add buttons that allow the user to only see boy or girl names (or all names).

The buttons should operate as "radio" buttons - exactly one should be active at any time.

The app should start by showing all names.

The app should make it clear which filter is in effect.

_How it works with search:_

If there is also a search term in effect, your app should apply any name gender filter to those search results.

# Beyond - ideas for more work

- Find a way to persist the favourites even after the browser tab is closed
- Add the ability for the user to shuffle the list of names
- Add the ability for the user to be presented with one or two randomly chosen names.
- Find an attractive way to differentiate names by gender that doesn't use blue/pink stereotypes.
- Add some suitably-themed sound effects for the UI.  Josh W Comeau's [useSound hook](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/react/announcing-use-sound-react-hook/) can help here, as can [freesound.org](https://freesound.org/)
