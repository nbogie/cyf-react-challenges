# Job Listing with Filtering

Complete the Frontend Mentor challenge "Job Listings with Filtering", with the rule changes below:

https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/job-listings-with-filtering-ivstIPCt

You will have to refer to the "brief" on that web page AND download the "starter" zip file and explore its contents.

## Rule changes and additions

- Use React!
- Ignore "Option 1" from the challenge document.
- Load the jobs data file as mentioned in "Option 2".
- DO NOT implement any filtering functionality at this point.
- Build only the desktop version - do not worry about responsive design at this point
- Name your GitHub repo exactly: `job-listings-react`
- Host on Netlify as usual
- Your Netlify site name must be in this format: cyf-USERNAME-jobs(.netlify.app)
- You may work in teams of maximum 2 people if you wish.
- This is also a CSS practice exercise, not only React. Your result should be laid out correctly.

## More Notes

- You do NOT need to buy anything to do this challenge. (The frontendmentor website also offers a "sketch file" for sale - you can ignore this.)
- You will need to log in to frontendmentor.io with github and download the "starter" file.
- There is no starting project repo provided by CYF for this challenge - you will make your own.

## Optional Extra

### Give feedback on the challenge

The author of the challenge (and the "countries" one) is interested in your feedback.

If you want to, take notes on anything in the challenge statement that you find unclear, and anything that you particularly enjoy in the challenge.
